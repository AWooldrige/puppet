# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).

server 1.uk.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 2.uk.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 3.uk.pool.ntp.org iburst

# I've set no access control at present. If the default is deny, then each
# individual server must be allowed, not sure how this would work with pool

# Access control configuration; see /usr/share/doc/ntp-doc/html/accopt.html for
# details. The web page
# might also be helpful.
#
# Note that “restrict” applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.
